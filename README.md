# Healthcare Management Optimization Analysis & Dashboard Creation

## Project Background

The **Healthcare Management Optimization** project leverages data from 2019 to May 2024 across multiple hospitals to provide critical insights into hospital operations, patient care, and financial management. This project aims to assist hospital administrators and healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, optimize resources, and enhance patient care.

With the rising demand for urgent, elective, and emergency care, hospitals face challenges in optimizing patient stay durations, managing billing practices, and ensuring efficient allocation of resources such as blood supply and medical staff. The dataset used in this project provides a comprehensive view of hospital operations, including patient demographics, hospital stay durations, medical conditions, insurance billing, and doctor performance across various facilities.

### Key insights and recommendations are provided across the following areas:

- **Patient Stay Duration**: Evaluation of patient stay lengths across hospitals, aimed at improving capacity management for both short- and long-term care.
- **Billing Practices by Insurance Providers**: Analysis of billing discrepancies and trends across different insurance providers, helping to identify areas for cost optimization.
- **Blood Supply Management**: Insights into universal blood donor and receiver distributions to ensure timely and efficient transfusions.
- **Doctor Performance**: Evaluation of doctors based on the number of patients treated and their associated billing, offering insights into workload and revenue contribution.
- **Medication Trends**: An analysis of the most commonly prescribed medications for various medical conditions, guiding pharmacy inventory management.

An interactive Tableau dashboard accompanies this project to provide a dynamic and visual exploration of the findings. 

Excel was used to inspect, clean, and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accurate and actionable insights.

By harnessing this data, healthcare providers can address key operational challenges, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of patient care.

### Dataset

This project utilizes a Kaggle dataset of patient records from multiple hospitals, highlighting key metrics such as hospital stay duration, billing amounts, insurance providers, and medical conditions.
